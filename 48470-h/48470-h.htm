    <p>
      Dear Angela,
    </p>
    <p>
      May I dedicate this little book to you, who are already a friend of the
      Maid?
    </p>
    <p>
      As you grow up you will meet certain wise people who will tell you that
      there was never any such person as Joan of Arc, or that, if she ever
      lived, she was mad, or an impostor. If you ask them how they know that,
      they will probably reply that Science is the source of their information.
      You can then answer that you prefer to begin with History, and ask these
      wise people if they have read even so much as Monsieur Quicherat&rsquo;s five
      volumes containing the Trial of Joan, and the evidence of her friends and
      enemies who knew her in her lifetime? As the books are in Latin and Old
      French, the people who speak about Joan disrespectfully have not read
      them, and do not know what they are talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>They say: What say they? Let them say!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Affectionately yours,
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE CHILDHOOD OF JOAN OF ARC
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>OAN OF ARC was
      perhaps the most wonderful person who ever lived in the world. The story
      of her life is so strange that we could scarcely believe it to be true, if
      ali that happened to her had not been told by people in a court of law,
      and written down by her deadly enemies, while she was still alive. She was
      burned to deach when she was only nineteen: she was not seventeen when she
      first led the armies of France to victory, and delivered her country from
      the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan was the daughter of a poor man, in a little country village. She had
      never learned to read, or write, or mount a horse. Yet she was so wise
      that many learned men could not puzzle her by questions: she was one of
      the best riders in France; one of the most skilled in aiming cannons, and
      so great a general that she defeated the English again and again, and her
      army was never beaten till her King deserted her. She was so brave that
      severe wounds could not stop her from leading on her soldiers, and so
      tender-hearted that she would comfort the wounded English on the field of
      battle, and protect them from cruelty. She was so good that her enemies
      could not find one true story to tell against her in the least thing; and
      she was so modest that in the height of her glory she was wishing to be at
      home in her father&rsquo;s cottage, sewing or spinning beside her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan, who was born at Domremy, in the east of France, on January 6, 1412,
      lived in a very unhappy time. For nearly a hundred years the kings of
      England had been trying to make themselves kings of France, just as they
      had been trying to make themselves kings of Scotland. Perhaps they might
      have succeeded, if they had confined themselves to one conquest at a time.
      But they left Scotland alone while they were attacking France, and then
      Scotland sent armies to help the French, as at other times the French sent
      armies to help Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight years before Joan was born a sad thing happened to her country.
      Henry V. of England had married the Princess Katherine of France, and the
      French, or some of them, tired of being beaten in war, consented to let
      the child of Henry and the Princess Katherine be their King, instead of
      the son of their old King. The old King&rsquo;s son was called &ldquo;the Dauphin&rdquo;;
      that was the title of the eldest son of the French kings. This Dauphin was
      named Charles. His friends went on fighting the English for his sake, but
      he was not crowned King. The coronations of French Kings were always done
      in the Cathedral at Rheims, where they were anointed with sacred oil. The
      oil was kept in a very old flask, which was said to have been brought from
      heaven, to a Saint, by an Angel. No eldest sen of the King was thought
      really King of France, after his father&rsquo;s death, till he had been anointed
      with this heavenly oil at Rheims by the Archbishop. It is important to
      remember this; you will see the reason afterwards. Now, Rheims was in the
      power of the English, so the Dauphin, Charles, could not go there and be
      made King in earnest. The English said that he was not the son of his
      father, the late King, which made him very unhappy. We shall hear how Joan
      comforted him and made him King for good and all. What Scots and Frenchmen
      could not do, she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the French were divided into two parties. Some sided with
      the Dauphin, Prince Charles; more, and especially all the people of
      Burgundy, and the Duke of Burgundy, a great and rich country, were on the
      side of the English. So they fought very cruelly, for the land was full of
      companies of ill-paid soldiers, who plundered the poor, so that towns fell
      into decay, many fields were empty of sheep and cows, and the roads became
      covered with grass. In the villages a boy used to watch all day, from the
      spire of the church, to see whether any soldiers were riding up. If they
      came, the cattle were driven into the woods, and men, women, and children
      ran to hide themselves, carrying such things away as they could. The
      soldiers of all sorts robbed equally, for they had often no regular pay,
      and the Scots were not behindhand in helping themselves wherever they
      went. Even gentlemen and knights became chiefs of troops of robbers, so
      that, whoever won in the wars, the country people were always being
      plundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of these miseries Joan was born, in a village where almost
      everybody was on the side of the Dauphin: the right side. In the village
      nearest to hers, Maxey, the people took the English side, and the boys of
      the two places had pitched battles with sticks and stones. It is true that
      they would have found some other reason for fighting, even if the English
      had not been in France. Joan used to see her brothers, Peter and John,
      come home from these battles with their noses bleeding, and with black
      eyes, but she did not take part herself in these wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her village was near a strong-walled town called Vaucouleurs, which was on
      the side of the Dauphin. When Joan was a little girl she did not see very
      much of the cruelty of the soldiers; the village was only visited once or
      twice by enemies. But she heard of what was going on in the rest of
      France: &ldquo;there was great pity in France,&rdquo; she said. She did, once or
      twice, see some of the &ldquo;pity.&rdquo; There was a man called Henry d&rsquo;Orly, living
      in a castle named Doulevant, who, like many other gentlemen in these days,
      was a captain of robbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day several spearmen of his rode into Domremy, Joan&rsquo;s village, and
      seized Joan&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s cows, with all the other cows that they could find,
      just as the Scotts, Elliots, and Armstrongs used to ride across the Border
      and drive the cattle of the English farmers. But a lady lived in a strong
      castle rear Domremy, and when she heard how the village people had been
      plundered she sent the news to a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who
      gathered his spearmen and rode after the robbers. The thieves, of course,
      could not ride faster than the stolen cows could trot; they pricked the
      poor beasts with their spears, and made them lumber along, but a cow is
      slow at best. The pursuers galloped and came on the cattle in a little
      town, while the thieves were drinking in the wine shops. When they heard
      the horses of the pursuers gallop down the street, they mounted their
      horses and spurred for their lives; but now came their master, Henry
      d&rsquo;Orly, with more spearmen, who followed after the cattle and the
      gentlemen who were driving them home. They turned and charged Henry
      d&rsquo;Orly, and cleared the road, and the cows came home to Domremy, all safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time all the people in Domremy had to fly from home, and go to a
      town called Neufchâteau, where they were safe behind strong walls. They
      only stayed there for a few days, but, later, the English said that Joan
      had been a servant in an inn at this town, and had learned to ride there,
      which was quite untrue.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0021.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      There were beautiful woods near the village, and in one oak wood an oak
      called the Fairy Tree. There was a story that a beautiful fairy used to
      meet her lover at that tree, just as under the Eildon Hill, the Queen of
      Fairyland met Thomas the Rhymer. The children used to take cakes, and make
      feasts, and hang garlands of flowers on the boughs of that oak; but Joan
      did not care much about fairies, and preferred to lay her wild flowers
      beneath the statues of Saints in the village Church, especially St.
      Catharine and St. Margaret. Of course, all this was long before the
      Reformation in which the Protestants broke the images of Saints in the
      churches, and smashed their pictures on the glass windows with stones, and
      destroyed a beautiful statue of Joan on the bridge at Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things were done more than a hundred years after Joan was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Joan could run faster than the other girls and boys, and beat them
      when they ran races, she liked to be quiet. Nobody could sew and spin
      better than she did, and she was very fond of praying alone in church. She
      would even go away from the other children into lonely places, and implore
      God to have pity on France. The services in church, the singing and music,
      made her very happy, and when she heard the church bells across the
      fields, she would say her prayer. She was very kind, and would give up her
      bed to any poor traveller whom her father took in for a night, and would
      sleep beside the hearth She took care of the sick, and, if ever she had
      any money, she would spend it on Masses to be said in honour of God, and
      for the sake of men&rsquo;s souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Joan lived till she was thirteen. She was a strong, handsome girl,
      beautifully made, with black hair. We do not know the colour of her eyes,
      probably brown or dark grey. A young knight wrote to his mother, when he
      first saw Joan, that she was &ldquo;a creature all divine.&rdquo; Jean never sat to a
      painter for her portrait, though once she saw a kind of fancy picture of
      herself in the hands of a Scottish archer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young men do not say so much about a girl who is not beautiful, and
      indeed, armies do not rush together to follow a maiden with no good looks.
      But though Jean, when she came to command armies, liked to be well
      dressed, and to have fine armour, that was partly because she was a
      natural, healthy girl, and partly because she was a kind of banner for men
      to follow into fight, and banners ought to be splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took, no thought of her own beauty, and the young knights and squires
      who fought, later, under her flag, said that they looked on her as a
      sacred thing, and never dreamed of making love to her She let it be known
      that she would never marry any one, while the English were still in
      France. She was not a nun, and had not made a vow never to marry at all,
      but while her country was in danger she never thought of marriage; she had
      other things to do.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. HOW THE VOICES CAME TO THE MAID
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Joan was about
      thirteen a very wonderful thing happened to her. One day she and the other
      girls and boys were running a race for a crown of flowers. Joan was easily
      the winner, and as she was running, a child who was looking on cried,
      &ldquo;Joan. I see you flying along without touching the ground.&rdquo; After the race
      Joan had a curious feeling as if she did not know where she was and then
      heard a young man&rsquo;s voice near her bidding her go home, for her mother
      needed her. She did not know who spoke; she thought it might be her
      brother, or one of her neighbours, so she ran home. She found that her
      mother had not sent for her, and she was going back to her friends, when a
      bright light like a shining cloud appeared to her, and a Voice told her to
      go and save France from the English. Till that hour she had been sorry for
      the sorrows in France, but as she was only a little girl, she had never
      thought that she could lead an army against the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the first account that people heard of the coming of the
      mysterious Voices to Jeanne: it was written down about four years after
      the Voices first came, and six weeks after Jean&rsquo;s first great defeat of
      the English (in May 1429). Two years later, after Joan was a prisoner of
      the English, the French priests and lawyers who took the English side
      asked her thousands of questions about everything that she had done in her
      life, and the answers were written down in a hook, word for word. They
      asked her about these wonderful Voices. There were things that she refused
      to tell these priests and lawyers, but she did say this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was about thirteen there came to me a Voice from God, teaching me
      how I was to behave and what I was to do. And the first time that Voice
      came, I was afraid. I was standing about the middle of the day, in summer,
      in my father&rsquo;s garden. The Voice came from the right hand, from where the
      church stands, and when it came I usually saw a great light on the side
      from which it spoke. The Voice told me to be a good girl and go to church,
      and go to save France. I said that I was only a poor girl, who could not
      ride or lead the soldiers in the wars,&rdquo; but the Voice kept on for years,
      telling her that she must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She not only heard Voices, but she saw shining figures of the Saints in
      heaven. She never would tell the lawyers much about how the Saints
      appeared to her, but said, &ldquo;I saw them as clearly as I see you, and I used
      to cry when they went away. And I wished that they would take me with them
      where they went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These Saints were St. Margaret, St. Catherine, and the Archangel St.
      Michael. When Joan spoke to her own friends about what she saw and heard
      they say that &ldquo;she seemed marvelously happy, lifting her eyes to heaven.&rdquo;
       This is all that we know about these wonderful things which kept Joan
      company from the time when she was thirteen to the day of her death, when
      she was nineteen, advising her about what she was to do for the saving of
      France. If the Voices had not spoken to her often, she would never have
      gone to the wars, and for some years she told nobody about the Voices, and
      stayed at home in her village. Even when she went to the wars, her friends
      could not persuade her to say more than I have told you about these
      strange things. She said that she had a &ldquo;council&rdquo; which advised her in
      everything. If there was much noise in a room where she might be, she
      could not hear the Voices distinctly. Only one person said that he saw
      angels&rsquo; faces in her company; none of her friends who knew her best saw or
      heard anything extraordinary. She very much disliked to speak about the
      Saints and Voices.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. HOW THE MAID OBEYED THE VOICES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>IME went on, and
      the Dauphin, the rightful Prince of France, was more and more unfortunate.
      It is true that Henry V., the King of England, died. He was a great
      soldier, and his son was only a baby, but the war was carried on by the
      brother of the late King, the Duke of Bedford; by the Earl of Salisbury;
      by the famous Talbot; by Sir John Fastolf, and many other English
      generals. The Scots won a great victory over the English at Baugé bridge,
      where the Duke of Clarence, the brother of Henry V., was killed. But the
      French and Scots were beaten at Verneuil, where most of the Scots fell
      fighting bravely. However, a new army came from Scotland, under Stewart of
      Dam-ley, and still the war went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that time the Dauphin only held France south of the great river Loire.
      The strongest place which was true to the Dauphin was the town of Orleans.
      If the English could once take that city, and fill it with previsions, and
      guns, and other weapons, the French could not hope to win it back again,
      and the English would overrun the whole of the centre and south of France,
      and drive the Dauphin out of his own country. He was very poor and very
      unhappy. He could scarcely pay his bootmaker, and as he was not a good
      fighting man, he lived here and there idly, at towns south of Orleans,
      such as Blois and Poitiers. He used to wonder whether he had not better
      give up the war and go to Spain or Scotland. Another thing made him
      miserable. He did not know for certain whether he had really the right to
      be King or not, as many people said that he was not truly the son of the
      last King of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his distress he prayed, privately and in silence, that he might know
      whether or not he was the rightful prince, and ought to be crowned and
      anointed as King. But he told nobody about this, and lived as he best
      could, wandering from one town to another. Then he heard that his great
      city of Orleans was being besieged by the English, in the autumn of the
      year 1428. Orleans lies on the right bank of the river Loire, which here
      is deep, broad, and swift, with several islands in the middle of the
      current. The bridge was fortified, on the farther side, by two strong
      towers, called Les Tourelles, but the English took this fortification, and
      so the people of Orleans could not cross the river by the bridge, and they
      broke down an arch, that the English might not cross to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the English general came to this fort, at the time when the
      soldiers of both sides dined, to look our of a narrow window, and watch
      what was going on in the besieged town. Now it happened that a cannon lay,
      ready loaded, in a niche of the gate tower of Orleans that looked straight
      along the bridge to the Tourelles. The English general, the Earl of
      Salisbury, was peeping through the narrow window, thinking himself quite
      safe, as the French soldiers in Orleans had gone to dinner. But a small
      French boy went into the gate-tower of Orleans, and seeing a cannon ready
      loaded, he thought it would be amusing to set a light to the touch-hole.
      So he got a linstock, as it was called, lighted it, put it to the
      touch-hole, and fired off the cannon. The bullet went straight into the
      narrow window out of which the English general was peeping, and he fell
      back, mortally wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a piece of good fortune for the French, but there were plenty of
      other English generals to take the place of Salisbury. The English built
      strong fortresses here and there, outside the walls and gates of the town,
      to prevent help and food and wine and powder from being brought to the
      besieged French. But the people of Orleans were brave, and were commanded
      by good officers, such as Dunois, young Xaintrailles. La Hire, a rough,
      swearing knight, and others who became true friends of Joan of Arc, and
      food was brought in easily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English had won so many battles that they despised the French, and so
      they did not take pains, and besides, they had not men enough to surround
      Orleans and prevent cattle being driven in from the country. The English
      seem to have had no more than four thousand soldiers. They were neither
      strong enough to take the town by storm, nor many enough to surround it
      and starve the French into showing the white flag, and giving up the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the English had been beating the French just because they
      believed they could beat them, and thought that one Englishman was as good
      as three Frenchmen at least. This was nonsense but, under Henry V., at
      Agincourt, a few English had beaten a great French army, because the
      French fought foolishly, trying to gallop to the charge over wet, heavy
      ploughed land, while the English arches shot them down in hundreds. But
      the French, you will see had learned the English way of fighting on foot,
      and could have held their own, if they had not lost confidence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. HOW JOAN HEARD NEWS STRANGELY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>OAN, far away in
      Domremy, would hear of the danger in which Orleans lay, now and then, and
      her Voices kept insisting that she <i>must</i> go and drive away the
      English. She used to cry, and say that she would be quite useless, as she
      could not ride or fight, and people would think her mad, or bad, and laugh
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Voices told her to go to the nearest strong-walled French town,
      Vaucouleurs, and ask the commander there, Robert de Baudricourt, to send
      her to the Dauphin, who was then far away, at Chinon, a castle on the
      Loire, south of Orleans. When she saw the King, she was to tell him that
      she had come to save France.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed quite a mad proposal. Baudricourt was a greet, rough, sensible
      soldier, and how could Joan go to him with a message of this kind? He
      would merely laugh at the sunburned girl in her short red kirtle&mdash;a
      girl who, probably, had never spoken to a gentleman before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this was the hardest part of Joan&rsquo;s duty, for she was modest, and
      she was very quick to notice anything absurd and ridiculous. Now nothing
      could seem more laughable than the notion that a little country wench of
      sixteen could teach the French to defeat the English. But there was no
      help for it. The Voices, and the shining cloud, and the faces of Saints
      and angels came, several times every week, and a Voice said, &ldquo;Daughter of
      God, go on! I will be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joan had an uncle who lived near Vaucouleurs, and she went to stay with
      him. It seems that she told him she must go to the Dauphin, and the first
      thing needful was to get Robert de Baudricourt to lend her a few
      men-at-arms, who would protect her on her long journey to Chinon. The
      uncle must have been very much astonished, but it seems that he believed
      in her, for he took her to Robert. Of course Robert laughed, and told
      Joan&rsquo;s uncle to take her away, and box her ears. But she came again, and
      then a priest wanted to exorcise her, that is to frighten the devil out of
      her, with religious services and holy water, as if she had been
      &ldquo;possessed,&rdquo; like people in the New Testament. But Joan was not possessed,
      and the priest, after trying the holy water, could only say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the month of February 1429 had come round. The besieged
      French in Orleans had now a great misfortune. The season of Lent was
      coming; that is, a time when they were not allowed to eat beef and mutton,
      but only fish, and eggs, and vegetables. Now a great number of waggons
      loaded with herrings were being sent to feed the English who were
      besieging Orleans. The general of the French in Orleans knew that, and he
      determined to send out soldiers to attack the English who would be
      guarding the long line of waggons full of herrings. They would wait for
      the English on the road, cut them up, and carry the fish into the town for
      their own use.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a great many of the Scots and some French slipped out of Orleans by
      night, and went to a place called Rouvray, on the road by which the
      herrings were to pass. Here they were to be joined by another small French
      army, under a general named Clermont. So they reached Rouvray, where they
      did not find Clermont and his men, but did see the English soldiers far
      away, marching by the side of the long line of waggons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of waiting hidden under cover till the English passed, by, and
      then rushing among them unexpectedly, Stewart of Damley cried, &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo;
       and rode, with his lance in rest at the English front. The Scots were
      always in too great a hurry to fight. The English saw them, coming,
      arranged the heavy waggons in a square, and went inside the square, so
      that the Scots could not get at them. Safe behind their carts, the English
      archers shot down the Scots, who thought bows and arrows rather mean
      weapons, and wanted to cut down their enemies with the sword. But they
      could not reach the English; they fell in piles of slain men round the
      square, and Clermont, the French general who was to have joined them,
      would not fight, and took away his army. So very many brave Scots were
      killed, with Stewart of Darnley at their head, and the rest retreated
      sadly to Orleans, where they heard the English hurrahing in their camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was called the battle of Rouvray, or the battle of the Herrings. It
      was fought on February 12, 1429. Now, on February 12, Joan went to
      Baudricourt, and told him that a terrible misfortune had happened that day
      to the army of the Dauphin, near Orleans. The news could not possibly
      reach Vaucouleurs for several days, for the distance between Vaucouleurs
      and Orleans is great, and the roads were dangerous, and might be beset by
      English soldiers and by robbers, who would stop messengers. Joan had been
      told of the defeat by her Voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, the bad news did come. Joan had been right, the French
      and Scots had been defeated on the day when she told Baudricourt of it,
      February 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Baudricourt saw there was something uncommon in this country girl, who
      knew what was happening far away, and he lent her two young: gentlemen and
      a few men-at-arms to guide her and guard her on her way to the Dauphin.
      Somebody gave her a horse, which, to the surprise of all men, she rode
      very well. She had her long black hair cut short and close, as soldiers
      wore it; she dressed in a grey doublet and black hose, like a boy (she
      wore this kind of dress till the end of her life); and then she rode
      through the gate of Vaucouleurs which is still standing, and away to seek
      the Dauphin. This was on February 23, 1429.
    </p>
    <p>
      After riding for several days, Joan and her company reached a little town
      called Fierbois, near Chinon. Here was the chapel dedicated to St.
      Catherine of Fierbois, who was a favourite Saint of the French and Scots
      soldiers, and of Joan. In the chapel was a book in which the miracles of
      the Saint were written down. At this very time a Scottish archer, Michael
      Hamilton, from Shotts, was caught by some country people, and was hanged
      by them. During the night a voice came to the priest of the village,
      saying, &ldquo;Go and cut down that Scot who was hanged, for he is not dead.&rdquo;
       However, the priest was sleepy, and he did not go. Next day was Easter
      Day, and the priest went to church and did the services. After that, he
      thought he might as well see about the Scot who was hanging from a tree,
      and seemed quite dead. To make certain, the priest took his penknife, and
      cut the dead man&rsquo;s toe. On this the man gave a kick, so the priest cut the
      rope, and took good care of Michael Hamilton. When he was able to ride,
      Michael went to this chapel of Fierbois, and took his oath that he had
      prayed to St. Catherine before he was hanged up, and now he came to thank
      her for his escape at her chapel. The book of the chapel is full of these
      strange stories, and probably some of them were read aloud to Joan, who
      could not read, and said that she &ldquo;did not know A from B.&rdquo; She attended
      three Masses at Fierbois, and get some learned clerk to write a letter to
      the King, to say that she was coming. She also had a letter written to her
      father and mother, asking them to pardon her for going away without their
      permission. Her father she was to see once more, her mother she never saw
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Michael Hamilton, you may believe his story or not, as you like.
      Many of the other stories told in the chapel book by Scots soldiers, and
      French men and women, are just as curious. I only know that the people
      made long journeys to thank Madame Saint Catherine in her church at
      Fierbois, and that their stories were written down in the book there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. HOW THE MAID SAW THE DAUPHIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Joan reached
      Chinon, she was lodged with a lady who was very kind, and she waited to
      see the Dauphin. His advisers were not sure that he ought to see the Maid
      at all; but probably he was curious, and at last she was brought to the
      castle, and led up the stairs to a great hall, where were many men in
      splendid dresses. The castle is in ruins now, and the hall has no roof
      over it, but you can still go in and see the walls, and empty windows, and
      the great fireplace. A man plainly dressed was in the crowd of magnificent
      courtiers in silk and gold embroidery. Joan went straight up, and kneeling
      on one knee, said, &ldquo;Fair Sir, you are the Dauphin to whom I am come.&rdquo; But
      the man pointed to a knight, very richly dressed, and said, &ldquo;That is the
      King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, fair Sir,&rdquo; said Joan; &ldquo;it is to you that I am sent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0043m.jpg" alt="0043m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0043.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The Dauphin, for the man was the Dauphin, was surprised at this, for she
      had never seen him before. He allowed Jean to come to the castle and talk
      to him, but he was not sure that she was not an impostor, or a silly girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, she took him aside, into a corner where nobody could
      hear what they were talking about. When their conversation was ended, the
      Dauphin looked very grave, and Jeanne looked very glad. She had told him
      something that made him believe in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had Joan told to the King? It was known at the time that she had told
      him something that amazed him, for it is mentioned in a letter written a
      few weeks later by Alan Chartier, a famous poet. But nobody knew the
      secret: Joan would never let any one know. When she was a prisoner among
      the English, the French-priests and lawyers tried to make her speak, but
      she would not. It was her King&rsquo;s secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight year&rsquo;s after Joan was dead, a very strange thing happened. A woman
      who said that Joan had not died, and that she was Joan, came to Orleans
      with Joan&rsquo;s brothers. The people of Orleans, who had known the Maid very
      well, believed that this woman was Joan come again, and feasted her and
      gave her presents. Then she was taken to the King. He himself was puzzled,
      and said, &ldquo;Maid, my dear, I am glad to see you again. Do you remember the
      secret between you and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then this false pretender to be the Maid confessed that she knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King was old, he revealed the secret to a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that day when they went apart together at Chinon. Joan reminded him of
      the secret prayer which, as I told you, the Dauphin had made when alone,
      asking that he might know whether he really was the son of the late King,
      and himself the rightful King of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> the rightful King,&rdquo; Joan said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Dauphin heard her words, he made things go on quicker. Priests
      were sent to Joan&rsquo;s village to find out if she had been a good girl when
      she was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was taken to Poitiers, to be examined by many learned men,
      priests and lawyers. They tried to perplex her by their questions, but she
      was straightforward, and told them how the Voices had come to her. One man
      asked her to give a sign by working a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not come to Poitiers to give signs.&rdquo; said Joan; &ldquo;but let me go to
      Orleans, and you shall see what I will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She never professed to work miracles. She wanted to lead an army to
      Orleans, and the sign to be given was the defeat of the English, and the
      rescue of the besieged town.
    </p>
    <p>
      For six weary weeks the learned men and priests examined Joan, and tried
      in every way to find some fault in her answers. At last they drew up a
      report and signed it, saying that &ldquo;to doubt the Maid would be to resist
      the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; What they were afraid of all the time was that Joan
      might be advised by spirits, to be sure, but evil spirits or devils. The
      English and the French lawyers on the English side, declared that Joan was
      possessed by devils. They thought that, because they could not deny her
      powers; but, as she was not on their side, her powers could not come from
      God, but from Satan. To think in that way is common: people always believe
      that their own side is the right side. But nobody ever heard of evil
      spirits taking possession of any one who was really good; and no man could
      ever find any single bad thing in Joan the Maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now the Dauphin began to collect an army to march with Joan to Orleans.
      Of course he ought to have done that before, even if there had been no
      Joan. It was a shameful thing that a strong town, full of brave men,
      should be taken by four thousand Englishmen, without an effort by the
      French to drive the English away. But the French had lost all heart and
      courage: the brave Danois himself said that a large force of French would
      run away from a little company of English. All that the French of the
      Dauphin&rsquo;s party needed was courage and confidence. As soon as they
      believed in Joan they were full of confidence. They could not turn their
      backs as long as a girl of sixteen ran forward in front of them, through
      the rain of arrows, and bullets, and cannon balls, waving her banner, and
      crying &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this time Joan prophesied that she would be wounded by an arrow at
      Orleans, but not to death. So a Flemish ambassador at Chinon wrote to the
      magistrates of his town at hone, and his letter was copied into the town
      council&rsquo;s book, before the Maid went to the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      White armour was made for Joan to wear, and a Scottish painter made a
      banner with sacred pictures for her to carry: his daughter was a great
      friend of Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Maid said that, as for a sword, if they dug in the ground behind the
      altar at the chapel of St. Catherine, in Fierbois, they would find a
      buried sword, which she wished to carry; and it was found, old and rusty,
      with five crosses on the blade. The Duke of Alençon, a young cousin of the
      King&rsquo;s, who had been a prisoner of the English, saw Joan riding one day,
      and was so pleased with her grace and good horsemanship, that he gave her
      a very good horse, and became one of her best friends. &ldquo;My fair Duke&rdquo; was
      what she used to call him. Every one said that Joan&rsquo;s manners were as
      gentle and courteous as those of the greatest ladies, though she had been
      brought up in a poor cottage. Everything that she did was done in the best
      way and the noblest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. HOW THE MAID RODE TO ORLEANS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Joan&rsquo;s army
      was gathered, with plenty of good things, and powder and shot, in waggons,
      for the people of Orleans, she gave orders that no loose people should
      follow them. The soldiers must not drink and play dice and cards. They
      must pray, and must never swear. One of the generals, the brave La Hire,
      asked that he might be allowed one little oath, so she said he might swear
      &ldquo;by his baton,&rdquo; the short staff which he carried as a leader. Then Joan
      mounted, and rode at the head of the amy out of the gate of Blois. The
      French Commander at Orleans, Danois, had sent to say that they must march
      up the bank of the Loire opposite to that on which Orleans stands, for the
      English were very strong, with many fortifications, on the road on the
      Orleans side, and would stop them. Dunois seems to have thought that
      Joan&rsquo;s army should go above the town, and be ferried across with the
      supplies for the city-for the English held the bridge&mdash;but that they
      could not cut their way through the main body cf the English army on the
      other side of the river. But to go straight through the English where they
      were strongest was what Joan had intended. Therefore she was angry when
      she arrived at the place where Dunois was waiting for her, and saw that
      the river lay between her and the town of Orleans. You may think that her
      Voices should have told her that she was marching on the wrong bank of the
      river: however, they did not. She asked Dunois why he had ordered them to
      come by the road they took. She said, &ldquo;I bring you better help than has
      ever come to any town or captain, the help of the King of heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunois himself has left this account of what Joan said, and, as she was
      speaking, the wind changed. It had been blowing in such a way as to make
      it hard for the boats to carry Joan and the provisions across the river,
      but now it went about, and they crossed easily, some way above the town.
      As for the army, Joan ordered them back to Blois, to cross by the bridge
      there, and march to Orleans again, past the forts and through the midst of
      the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once across the river, Joan mounted again, with her banner of Our Lord and
      the Lilies in her hand, and with Dunois at her side, and rode to the town.
      They passed an English fortress, the Church of St Loup, in safety, and the
      people came out to meet them. Night had fallen, and the people who crowded
      round the Maid were carrying torches. Ore of these set fire to the fringe
      of her banner and made her horse plunge; but she crushed out the flame
      with her left hand in its steel glove, and reined in her horse easily,
      while the people cheered, and the women wished to kiss her hand, which she
      did not like, thinking the honour too great. It was a beautiful sight to
      see the Maid ride into Orleans town. From that hour there was no more fear
      among the French.

    <p>
      Dunois said, &ldquo;till that day, two hundred English could scatter eight
      hundred or a thousand cf our men, but now they skulked in their forts and
      dared not come out against us.&rdquo; This is an extraordinary thing, for
      Talbot, who led the English, was the bravest of men, and was thought the
      greatest captain living. Jeanne sent to him a letter to bid him break up
      his camp and go away. The English laughed, and one day, when Joan went out
      to speak to them, they called her ill names, so that she wept for shame.
      But, somehow, the English had certainly lost heart, or they had some
      reason which we do not know, for merely defending their strong fortresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day after Joan entered Orleans she wanted Dunois to sally out of
      the town with his men and assail the English. He did not think it wise to
      do so and Joan went up to her own room. Suddenly she rushed down and asked
      her page why he had not told her that the French were fighting, she did
      not know where. It was at the fort and Church of St. Loup, which Joan had
      passed on her way into Orleans. On this side, namely, farther up the
      river, above the town, the English were weakest, as they did not expect to
      be attacked on that side. The French were victorious: when they saw Joan
      ride up they were filled with courage. Joan saw a Frenchman strike down an
      English prisoner: she dismounted; laid the poor prisoner&rsquo;s head in her
      lap, and did her best to comfort him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. HOW THE MAID SAVED ORLEANS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Dauphin had
      given Joan a gentle-man of good character to be with her always, and take
      care of her. This gentleman was named Jean d&rsquo;Aulon, and, as he has left an
      account of what Joan did at Orleans, we give what he said. On the day
      after Joan took the fortress of St. Loup from the English, she led her men
      to attack another English work on the farther side of the river. They
      could not cross by the bridge, of course, for the English held the strong
      building, Les Tourelles, at the bridge end, the place where the Earl of
      Salisbury was killed by the cannon shot; moreover an arch of the bridge
      had been broken, lest the English should cross. So they went in boats to
      an island in the middle of the river, and then made a bridge of boats
      across the other branch of the Loire. But they found that the English had
      left the place which they meant to attack, and were in a much stronger
      fortress. The French, therefore, were returning to their boats, when the
      English rushed out of the second fortress to attack them when off their
      guard. But Joan and her friend La Hire, who had crossed the river with
      their horses, saw the English coming on, and put their lances in rest (a
      kind of support for the level spear), and spurred their horses at their
      enemies. The rest of the French followed Joan, and drove the English back
      into their fortress. Meanwhile d&rsquo;Aulon, and a Spanish gentleman on the
      French side, took each other by the hand, and ran as fast as they could
      till they struck their swords against the outer fence, or strong wooden
      palisade of the English. But in the narrow gateway stood a tall and very
      strong Englishman, who drove back the French. So d&rsquo;Aulon asked a
      Frenchman, a good shot, to aim at the Englishman, whom he killed, and then
      d&rsquo;Aulon and the Spaniard ran into the gateway, and held it, while Joan and
      the rest of the French rushed in, and all the English were killed or gave
      themselves up as prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the French army which went down to Blois to cross the bridge,
      had returned to Orleans, and gone past the English fortresses without
      being attacked. So there were now many fighting men in Orleans. Next day,
      therefore, Joan insisted that they should attack the strongest of all the
      English forts, Les Tourelles, at the end of the bridge farthest from the
      town. The generals thought this plan too dangerous, as the fortress was so
      strong; but no doubt Joan was right, because the English on the town side
      of the river could not cross over to help their countrymen. If they
      crossed in boats, they would be shot, and cut down as they landed. If the
      French generals did not understand that. Joan did. She was full of
      confidence. A man asked her to wait for breakfast, and offered her a big
      trout caught in the Loire. She said, &ldquo;Keen it for supper. I will bring
      back an English prisoner to help to eat it. And I will come back <i>by the
      bridge</i>,&rdquo; Now the bridge, we saw, was <i>broken</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0061.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Aulon heard her say this, and no doubt he wondered what she meant. He
      understood her, at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Joan caused the gate to be thrown open, and the town&rsquo;s people, who were
      very eager, rushed to the river bank, and crossed in boats. The regular
      soldiers followed, and all day long they attacked the walls, carrying
      ladders to climb then? with, while Joan stood under the wall, waving her
      banner, and crying &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; But from behind the battlement, the English
      kept shooting with arrows and muskets, so that many of the French were
      killed, and a strong Englishman threw down the ladders as they were pushed
      to the top of the walls. There were five or six hundred of the best of the
      English in this castle, under two leaders whom the French call &ldquo;Bumus&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Glasidas.&rdquo; The name of &ldquo;Glasidas&rdquo; was Glasdaie; we do not know who
      &ldquo;Bumus&rdquo; was! So all day companies of the French and Scots, carrying
      ladders, and with banners flying, went down into the deep ditch below the
      wall, and were shot or driven out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the great Dunois, the most famous of the French leaders, tells us what
      Joan did. It was about one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when the thing that
      she had prophesied happened to her. A bolt from an English cross-bow
      passed through her armour between the collar-bone and the shoulder-blade,
      and stood out six inches behind her shoulder. She was carried out of
      range, and the arrow was drawn out. Another witness says that a soldier
      wished to sing a magical song over the wound, to heal it, but she would
      not allow this to be done, and went back into the battle, hurt as she was.
      She cried a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fought on: they had begun in the early morning, and it was eight
      o&rsquo;clock, and past sunset, when Dunois said that they could not take the
      fort that day, and wished to call off the soldiers from the ditch. But
      Joan came to him, and asked him to wait a little while. She mounted her
      horse, and rode to a vineyard, and there she prayed, &ldquo;for half a quarter
      of an hour.&rdquo; Then she rode back, and went through the hail of shot and
      arrows to the edge of the ditch, while d&rsquo;Aulon covered her, he says, with
      his shield. She saw that a soldier had taken her standard into the ditch.
      She seized the standard, and it waved so that all her men saw it, and
      rushed up; &ldquo;we shall take the fort,&rdquo; said Joan, &ldquo;when my standard touches
      the wall.&rdquo; The wind blew the banner fringe against the wall, and the
      French made one more rush, they climbed the ladders, they tumbled into the
      fort, and the English were slain or taken, and Glasdale, their leader, who
      tried to cross to another tower by a plank, fell into the river and was
      drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Joan crossed back to Orleans by the bridge, as d&rsquo;Aulon heard her say
      that she would, when she set out in the morning. For the town&rsquo;s people
      laid a beam across the broken arch, and on this she walked over, after
      winning so great a victory by her own courage. For Dunois says that the
      English were terrified when they saw her under the wall again, in the
      growing darkness, and that they had no more heart to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan was very tired: she had her wound dressed by a surgeon, and, for
      supper, she had four or five little pieces of toast, dipped in weak wine
      and water: that was all she ate, Dunois says, all that long day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early next morning the English left their forts, and drew up in line of
      battle. Joan had put on a very light shirt of mail, made of steel rings,
      because her wound did not permit her to wear the usual armour made of
      heavy steel plates. She said that the English must be allowed to go away,
      and must not be attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the town of Orleans was delivered on 8th May, and ever since, to this
      day, they keep a festival on 8th May in every year, ard rejoice in honour
      of the Maid. All the expense and labour of the English in the seven
      months&rsquo; siege had been turned to waste by Joan in four days, France was
      free, south of the Loire, and Joan had kept her word, she had shown a sign
      at Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sounds like a fairy-tale, but it certainly happened. Joan made the
      French able to do what they did merely by giving them courage. Her army
      would not have come together if she had not given them something to
      believe in-herself. She thought that she led about 10,000 men; but it is
      not easy to be sure of the numbers. The English, if they were only 4000,
      could not resist the new army and the old garrison of Orleans, if the
      French had faith in themselves; and Joan gave them faith. At the same time
      the English seem to have arranged their army in a very foolish way. About
      1000 were or the farther side of a river which the 3000 on the right bank
      could not, or did not try to cross, to help their friends. The larger part
      of the English army might have attacked one of the gates of Orleans, and
      frightened Joan&rsquo;s army, who would have come back across the river to
      defend the town. The English in the fortress at the farther end of the
      bridge would then have been safe. But the English on the right bank did
      nothing at all, for some reason which we do not understand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. HOW THE MAID TOOK THE TOWN OF JARGEAU
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER Orleans was
      quite safe, and when Talbot had led the English army to the town of Meun,
      Joan wanted to take the Dauphin to Rheims, to be crowned and anointed with
      the holy oil, and made King in earnest. But the way was long, and the road
      passed through towns which were held by friends of the English. So the
      Dauphin loitered about in pleasant castles near the Loire, in the bright
      May weather, and held councils, and wondered what he ought to do. Then
      Joan rode with the brave Dunois to Loches where the Dauphin was. Some
      lords and priests were in the room with him, but Joan went straight in,
      and knelt before him, saying, &ldquo;Fair Dauphin, do not hold so many weary
      councils, but come to Rheims, and take your crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they said that they would think about it, but was it safe to leave
      English armies behind them, at Meun, where Talbot was, and at Jargeau,
      where the Earl of Suffolk was the English captain? Joan said that she and
      the young Duke of Alençon would make their minds easy on that point, and
      would begin by taking Jargeau, where the French, without Joan, had fought
      already and been beaten. The Duke was newly married to a young wife, who
      was anxious about him, but Joan said, &ldquo;Madam, I will bring back the Duke
      to you, safe and well!&rdquo; So they rode away, six hundred lances, with some
      infantry, and slept in a wood. The Duke of Alençon has left an account of
      all that they did. Next day Dunois and other captains joined them with
      another six hundred lances, so that, with the infantry, they would be
      about five thousand men. Some of the captains thought they were not strong
      enough, as Jargeau had thick walls and rowers, and cannon. But Joan
      insisted on fighting and first she led her men to drive the English from
      the houses lying under the walls on the outside, which is dangerous
      fighting, as all the garden walls would protect English cross-bowmen, and
      men with muskets, who could shoot in safety, many of them from windows of
      houses, at the French in the open. The French, however, drove the English
      from the houses and gardens, and brought up their cannon, and fired at the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these days cannon were small, and shot small balls, which did not carry
      far, and could do no damage to thick stone walls. There were no shells,
      which explode, but there were a few very large iron guns, like Mons Meg in
      Edinburgh Castle. Out of these they shot huge, heavy stone balls, and if
      one of them fell into a street, and broke, the splinters flew about
      dangerously. But, somehow, they seldom did much harm, besides Joan&rsquo;s army
      had none of these great guns, which are not easily dragged about.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for days the French fired at the town, and it is to be supposed that
      they broke a hole, or breach, in a part of the wall, for they decided to
      rush in and take the place sword in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward, fair Duke!&rdquo; said Joan to the Duke of Alençon, who rather thought
      that they had not made a good enough breach in the wall. &ldquo;You know that I
      told the Duchess I would bring you back safe? But do not stand <i>there</i>,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;or that English cannon on the wall will kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke moved from the place where he was, and a gentleman named da Luce
      went to it, and was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Joan saved the Duke, as she had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they ran together to the wall, and Jean was climbing up a ladder,
      when a heavy stone thrown by the English struck her helmet, and she fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose again at once, crying, &ldquo;Forward, we shall take them all,&rdquo; and the
      English ran through the streets to the bridges, the French following and
      cutting them down, or taking them prisoners. It is said that the Earl of
      Suffolk surrendered to Joan, as &ldquo;the bravest woman in the world.&rdquo; If this
      is true, she might have made a great deal of money out of his ransom, that
      is, the price which a prisoner paid for his freedom. There is another
      story that Suffolk was taken by a squire, and that he dubbed him knight
      before he surrendered as it was more honourable to yield to a knight. This
      is more likely to be true, for the English thought that Joan was a witch.
      Now, as Suffolk was general of all the English forces on the Loire he
      would not choose to surrender to a lass of sixteen, whether he believed in
      witches or not Besides, he could not dub Joan a knight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. HOW JOAN DEFEATED THE ENGLISH IN FAIRFIELD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Maid had now
      driven the English away from Orleans, and had taken a strong town which
      they held, a thing the French, without her, had failed to do. She was next
      to beat their army In the open country and in fair field. We know most
      about this battle from a book written by a gentleman named Pierre de
      Cagny, who rode with the Duke of Alencon and knew what happened, and wrote
      all down very soon afterwards. He says that the Maid placed a garrison of
      soldiers to keep Jargeau, and then rode to Orleans with the Duke, where
      the townspeople gave a great feast to her and her friends. But she did not
      stay long to be petted and praised at Orleans. In the evening she said to
      the Duke, &ldquo;I am going, after dinner tomorrow, to see the English at Meun.
      Have the men ready to march.&rdquo; She easily made Meun surrender, and then her
      guns fired at the town of Beaugency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then news came to Joan that the whole English army, under Talbot and Sir
      John Fastolf (who cannot be Sir John Falstaff in Shakespeare, for the fat
      knight was dead), were marching against her. Now Sir John Fastolf, though
      a very brave captain, thought, like the fat knight, that &ldquo;discretion was
      the better part of valour.&rdquo; He wished to be cautious, and to avoid a
      battle, for he saw that the French were in high spirits, while the English
      soldiers had lost heart. This is told in the book written by a knight
      named Jean de Wavrin, a Burgundian. He was, like all of them of Burgundy,
      on the English side, and he rode under the banner of Sir John Fastolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you generally how we come to know the things done by the Maid, to
      show that the story is true, as the people who described it were present,
      and saw what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other English captains thought Sir John rather too cautious, and
      Talbot said. &ldquo;By St George. I will fight if I have only my own few men
      with me!&rdquo; Next morning the English rode out with banners flying, and again
      Sir John said that they were too few, and that they were risking all that
      Henry V. had gained in France. But Talbot and the rest would not listen to
      him, so the trumpets blew, and the horsemen rode on towards Meun, which
      Joan had taken. When they came to a place about three miles from Meun, and
      three from Beaugency, they saw the banner of the Maid, with Our Lord and
      the Lilies of France, and the banners of the Duke of Alençon, and Dunois,
      and La Hire, and young Pothon de Xaintrailles, a very gallant boy, waving
      over the ranks of 6000 men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English then did what Henry V. had taught them to do. They dismounted
      from their horses to fight on foot, and made each bowman plant his sharp
      stake in front of him, to stop a cavalry charge. This plan usually
      succeeded. The French were fond of charging with their cavalry at full
      speed, and then were usually shot down in heaps by the English bowmen,
      whom they could not reach, as they were safe behind their fence of pikes.
      Then the dismounted English would rush out, sword in hard, among the
      disordered French cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see this was much like part of the battle of Waterloo, when the French
      cavalry many times rode at the English squares, and could not break
      through the bayonets, while the English were shooting at them not very
      straight!
    </p>
    <p>
      By this plan of fighting the English had often defeated the French, and
      usually defeated the Scots, who generally made a wild rush at them. At the
      battle of Dupplin, soon after Robert Bruce died, the English archers shot
      from each flank till the Scots, as they charged, fell dead in heaps as
      high as a tall spear. But Dunois, and the fair Duke, and the Maid knew
      this plan. They sent a herald to bid the English go home to bed; it was
      late; &ldquo;tomorrow we shall have a nearer view of each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The English, therefore, went off to Meun, where nobody resisted them
      except the French soldiers who guarded the bridge over the Loire. The
      English meant to beat the French from the bridge with their cannons, cross
      the river, and march to help their friends in Beaugency, which had not yet
      yielded to Joan. The English would thus take Joan&rsquo;s army between two
      fires, that of Beaugency, and that of Talbot&rsquo;s army.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that very night the English in Beaugency lost heart, and yielded to
      the Maid, being allowed to march away with their arms and horses. Jean now
      bade the French captains go with her army, and look for Talbot&rsquo;s and
      Fastolfs force, who would hear of the surrender of Beaugency, and retreat
      to Paris through the country called La Beauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how are we to find the English?&rdquo; the French leaders asked Joan: for
      they would be in a wild, empty country covered with forests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride forth,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we shall take them all. As to finding them, <i>you
      shall have a good guide!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had a strange guide, as you shall hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English were marching along, in front was their advanced guard, under
      a knight who carried a white banner. Next came the guns, with the waggons
      full of provisions. Third was the main body of the army, under Talbot and
      Fastolf; and last rode the rear-guard. When they were near a place called
      Pathay, their scouts galloped in, with news that they had seen the French
      army. The English halted, and sent out more scouts, who rode back with the
      same news.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Talbot sent his advanced guard, the guns, and the waggons behind some
      tall hedges. The main body of the English army was being placed at the end
      of a long lane between two thick hedges, and Talbot set five hundred of
      his best archers to lurk behind these hedges, between which the French
      would have to pass before they could attack the centre of his forces. If
      the French once entered this long lane, they would be shot down, and fall
      into such confusion among their own fallen men and wounded horses, that
      they would neither be able to go forward nor back, and would all be killed
      or taken prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French of Joan&rsquo;s army could not see what Talbot was doing, and the
      trap he had set, nor where his army was, the country being covered with
      wood and bracken, and the English being concealed by the swelling of the
      ground. However, they rode forward fast, and would bare been between the
      fire of the two hidden lines of English bowmen in a minute, when, lo and
      behold! they had &ldquo;the good guide&rdquo; that Joan had promised them! As they
      rode they roused a stag from the bracken where he was lying: the stag
      rushed forward into the concealed lines of English archers, and they,
      being hunters like Robin Hood&rsquo;s men, forgot to lie still, and raised a
      view halloo, and shot at the stag. Then the foremost riders of the French
      heard them, and knew where the English were lying in ambush. When Talbot
      saw that his ambush was found out, he hurried the main body of hie army up
      to the hedges. Sir John Fastolf&rsquo;s men were spurring their horses on to
      join their advanced guard, but the English knight of the white banner who
      led thought that Fastolf&rsquo;s cavalry were French, and that the French were
      attacking: his men both in front and rear, So he and his company ran away
      leaving: the lane unguarded. Thus, when the battle began, Talbot was
      defeated by Joan&rsquo;s cavalry, and taken prisoner, and 2200 of the English
      were killed or taken before Fastolf came up. He and his horsemen then rode
      away as fast as they could, to save their lives, and for this behaviour
      Sir John got into very deep disgrace, though, according to Wavrin, who was
      with him, he really could have done nothing else, as Talbot was beaten
      before he could arrive. As Wavrin had taken part in the flight, he had to
      make as good a defence of Sir John as he could. At all events, Joan and
      her party won a very great victory, the battle of Pathay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now look what Joan had done. She drove the English from Orleans on 8th
      May. Then the Dauphin took to holding long and weary councils, and she did
      not get another chance to fight the English till about 4th June, so nearly
      a month of her one year of time was wasted. On 11th June she took Jargeau,
      on 15th June she took Meun, on 17th June she took Beaugency, and on 18th
      June she destroyed Talbot&rsquo;s chief army at Pathay!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Alencon tells us that he himself heard Joan tell the Dauphin,
      again and again, that &ldquo;she would only last for a year, or not much longer,
      and that he must make haste.&rdquo; She had four things to do, she said: to
      drive the English in flight, to crown the King at Rheims, to deliver
      Orleans, and to set free the Duke of Orleans, who was a prisoner in
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did drive the English in flight, she did save Orleans, she did have
      the Dauphin crowned. But the French would not make haste. The Dauphin was
      always slow, and the stupid political advisers who never fought but only
      talked, made him more slow, and, when Joan&rsquo;s year was over, for her
      prophecy was true, she was taken prisoner by the English. Therefore they
      were not driven quite out of France till about twenty years or more after
      the end of the year of Joan the Maid. It was not her fault. She knew that
      her time was short, and she told them to make haste. When she was asked
      how she knew things that were to happen, she said that her Voices told
      her, &ldquo;my Council,&rdquo; she called them. But there was a French noble, La
      Tremoïlle, the King&rsquo;s favourite, and he was jealous of Jean and Dunois and
      the Constable of Brittany, an enemy of his, who had now come to ride under
      Joan&rsquo;s flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Tremoille, and others, did not want to fight, and hoped to make
      friends with the Duke of Burgundy, whose array, though really French,
      fought on the side of the English. Now the one chance was to keep hitting
      the English hard and often, while they were shaken by their defeats, and
      before they had time to bring a new host from home. In England there was
      an army ready, which had been collected by Cardinal Beaufort, to fight the
      Hussites, a kind of warlike Protestants who were active in Germany. As
      soon as Joan had beaten the English at Orleans, they made up their minds
      to send this new army of theirs to protect Paris, where most of the
      people, and the University, were on the English side. They also made an
      arrangement with James I. of Scotland, so that they had nothing to fear
      from the Scots coming over the Border to attack them. The English were
      able to do all this because La Tremoïlle and his friends advised the
      Dauphin to loiter about, instead of making haste, as Joan desired, to keep
      on beating the English.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. HOW JOAN LED THE DAUPHIN TO BE CROWNED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e may think that
      Joan&rsquo;s best plan would have been to attack the English in Paris at once,
      while they were still in a fright, after their great defeat at Pathay. But
      she thought that if the Dauphin was once crowned, and anointed with the
      holy oil, at Rheims, the French who were of the English party would join
      him more readily. Robert the Bruce, in the same way, had himself crowned
      at Scone, which, in Scotland, was the usual place for coronations, when he
      had only very few followers, and very little chance of beating the
      English. Rheims, as you can sec on the map, is a long way farther from
      Orleans than Paris, on the north-east.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Joan had made up her mind to drag the Dauphin to Rheims to be crowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dauphin was lingering at Gien, which is some distance south of
      Orleans, instead of being at the head of his army, and in the front of the
      fighting, where he should have been. His lazy and cowardly favourites told
      him that it was a long way to Rheims, and on the road there were several
      towns with strong walls, and castles full of Englishmen and Burgundians,
      who would not let him pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan answered that she knew this very well, and cared nothing about it:
      all the towns and castles would yield and open their gates. So she left
      the Dauphin to do as he pleased, and went away with her company into the
      country. The Dauphin had no money to pay his troops, but men-at-arms came
      in, hundreds of them, saying that they would fight for the love of the
      Maid and of chivalry. No doubt they would have been very glad to crown <i>her</i>,
      in place of the stupid Dauphin, but the French law did not allow it; and
      Joan wanted nothing for herself, only to make France free, and go back to
      her mother, as she said. However, the Dauphin, who was grateful in his
      lazy way, made her and her brothers, Peter and John, nobles, and gave her
      a coat-of-arms, a sword supporting the Crown, with the Lilies of France on
      each side, and changed their name to du Lys. But Joan never used her
      coat-of-arms, but bore a Dove, silver, on a blue shield. Her brothers were
      with her, and seem to have fought very well, though in most ways they were
      quite ordinary young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Joan went away, the Dauphin made up his mind at last to march to
      Rheims, going first to Troyes, a strong town on the road. All the castles
      and fortresses on the way, instead of resisting him, submitted to him, as
      Joan had said that they would. At Troyes, where he came on 8th July, the
      English garrison, and the people of the town who were on the English and
      Burgundian side, wanted to oppose him. They fought on the 8th and 9th of
      Jury. The Dauphin&rsquo;s advisers did not want to fight, the brave Dunois tells
      us, but Jean said, &ldquo;Gentle Dauphin, bid your army besiege the town, and do
      net hold these long councils, for in three days I will bring you into the
      town.&rdquo; Then down she went to the great ditch or fosse round the town, and
      worked harder, says Dunois, than two or three of the most famous knights
      could have done. The people of Troyes then yielded to Joan, and they had a
      great feast in the city, which they needed, for the army had been living
      on soup made from the beans in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went on to Rheims, and the Archbishop and all the people came
      out to meet them, with shouts of joy. On 17th July the Dauphin, with Joan
      and all his nobles, went to the Cathedral, and there he was crowned and
      anointed, and made King in earnest, Joan standing beside him with her
      banner in her hand. This was her happiest day, perhaps, and the last of
      her great days. She had done so much! In the beginning of May there was
      every chance that the English would take Orleans, and sweep across the
      Loire, and seize all France, and drive the Dauphin into Spain, or across
      the sea to Scotland, and France would have been under the English for who
      knows how long. But in two months Joan had driven the English behind the
      walls of Paris, and her Dauphin was King in deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Maid knelt at the King&rsquo;s feet and wept for joy, in the great
      Cathedral, among the splendid nobles, and the lights, and the
      bright-coloured coats-of-arms, and the sweet smoke of incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentle King,&rdquo; she said, calling him &ldquo;King&rdquo; for the first time, &ldquo;now is
      the will of God fulfilled!&rdquo; and the knights themselves wept for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the crowd was an elderly countryman in his best clothes.
      Joan&rsquo;s father, whom now she saw for the first time since she left her
      village, and for the last time in her life. The King asked her to choose a
      gift and reward, and she asked that the people of her village, Domremy,
      should be free from paying taxes, and they were made free, and never paid
      taxes again, for three hundred years. On the books of the accounts of
      money paid by every town and village of France is written, after the names
      of Domremy and the village nearest it, Greux, <i>Nothing. For the Sake of
      the Maid.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper in which the King ordered that they should pay nothing may still
      be seen, dated the last of July 1429.
    </p>
    <p>
      How glad the people at Domremy must have been when Joan&rsquo;s father came home
      with the good news!
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the last glad day of the Maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she rode to Rheims, some people from Domremy met her and asked her if
      she was afraid of nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of nothing but treachery,&rdquo; she said, and, from this day, she met
      treachery among the King&rsquo;s advisers, who held long councils, and did not
      fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she rode from Rheims towards Paris, the people shouted round her, and
      she said that they were kind people, and she would like to be buried in
      their cathedral&mdash;she, who was never to be buried in the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan,&rdquo; said the Archbishop, &ldquo;in what place do you expect to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where God pleases, for of that hour and that place I know nothing more
      than you do. But would to God that now I might take off my armour, and go
      home to my father and mother,&rdquo; for, as she had seen her father, she was
      longing for her mother more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, the people about the King-, and the King himself, did not obey
      Joan, and all went wrong.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. HOW THE MAID WAS BETRAYED AT PARIS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE French should
      have followed the Maid straight to Paris, as she bade them do. But they
      went here and went there, and one day their army and that of the Duke of
      Bedford met, but did not fight; and another day there were skirmishes
      between the English and the Scots, &ldquo;who fought very bravely,&rdquo; says the
      Burgundian knight, Enguerrand de Manstrelet, who wrote a history of those
      times. The strong town of Compiègne, which had often been taken and
      retaken, yielded to Joan&rsquo;s army, and the King stayed there, doing nothing,
      which was what he liked, and the Duke of Burgundy gave him excuses for
      loitering by sending ambassadors, and pretending that he would give up
      Paris, for at this time there was no English garrison there. The poor
      people of the town were on the side of Joan and the King, and now, when
      the English were out of the great city, was the time to take it. But the
      King kept hoping to make peace with the Duke of Burgundy, so Joan, with
      her friend the Duke of Alençon, went to Saint Denis, quite close to Paris,
      where the Kings of France used to be buried: Saint Denis was the Saint of
      France, as Saint George was the Saint of England, and Saint Andrew of
      Scotland. There fought the Duke and the Maid, but the King came on very
      slowly, while Joan was in the front of battle every day, at one gate of
      Paris or another. At last, by often going to him, and urging him to come,
      Alençon brought the King to Saint Denis, but not before a strong new
      English army had arrived in the town, of which the walls and towers were
      very high and thick, and the fosses broad and deep, and full of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Joan led on her men and the Duke&rsquo;s, with her banner in her hand, and
      cried them on to break down a gate called the Porte St. Honoré.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percival de Cagny, who rode under the standard of Alençon, was in the
      battle, and he says, &ldquo;The fight was long: and fierce, and it was wonderful
      to hear the noise of guns and culverins from the walls, and to see the
      arrows fly like clouds. Few of those who went down into the dry ditch with
      the Maid were hurt, though many others were wounded with arrows and stone
      cannon balls, but, by God&rsquo;s grace and the Maid&rsquo;s favour, there were none
      but could return without help. We fought from noon till darkness began.
      After the sun set, the Maid was wounded by a bolt from a cross-how in the
      thigh, but she only shouted louder to &lsquo;come on and the place was ours.&rsquo; 
      But when it was dark and all were weary, men came from the King and
      brought her up out of the ditch against her will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0093.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Next day the Maid rose early, and went to the Duke of Alençon, who never
      failed her. The trumpets blew, and a new ally came, the Baron de
      Montmorency, with sixty gentlemen and their men-at-arms, and they were
      riding to attack Paris again when the King sent messengers to forbid them
      to do as their hearts desired. So they had to go to see him at Saint
      Denis. But the Duke of Alencon was having a bridge of wood thrown across
      the river Seine, at a new place, and they meant to cross by that bridge
      next day, and attack Paris again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shameful to say, the King had that bridge taken to pieces during the
      night, and when Joan and the Duke led their men there next day, they found
      only the river, which they could not ford. So the King of France saved
      Paris from d&rsquo;Alençon and the Maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard I. of England would have battered down the Paris gate with his own
      battle-axe; Henry V. or James IV. of Scotland, or Prince Charlie, would
      have been, foremost in the fight; but this King of France, Charies VII.,
      unworthy of his country and his ancestors, sneaked off to his pretty
      little town of Gien, on the Loire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thus was the will of the Maid broken, and the army of the King,&rdquo; says
      Percival de Cagny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Alencon kept his men together, and told the King that, if he
      would let the Maid ride with him, they would march into Normandy, and
      attack the English where they were strongest. But the King would not hear
      of it, and the Maid, with almost a broken heart, hung up her armour at the
      altar of Saint Denis, in his Cathedral. Half of her year was spent, and
      the King made her stay with him in the towns on the Loire, when he might
      have been in Paris, his capital, if he had only trusted Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the English retook some of the French towns that Joan had
      given to the King, and seized her sacred armour in the Church of Saint
      Denis, and punished and plundered the people, who were worse off than
      before, while the Maid was only allowed now and then to attack the
      English, and defeat them in the old way.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE wise King had
      arranged with the Duke of Burgundy that they two should be at peace till
      Easter, 1430; while he might fight the English as much as he liked, which
      was, not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the English let the Duke of Burgundy be Governor of Paris. It was
      always Paris that the Maid wished to take for her King, as it was the
      greatest city and the capital of France. But the King said she must not
      attack Paris, for it was now under the Duke of Burgundy, not under the
      English. All this was mere pretence, to avoid fighting. Jean&rsquo;s aim was to
      turn the English and their child King, Henry VI., out of her country; and
      the English were not likely to go out till they were driven out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English still held towns on the river Loire, such as St.
      Pierre-le-Moustier and La Charité. Joan went to Bourges and gathered an
      army, with a gentleman named d&rsquo;Elbret to help her, and besieged the town
      of St. Pierre-le-Moustier. When they had battered the walls for some time
      with their guns, and made a breach, the French tried to rash through it;
      but the English were too strong and too many, and drove them out At this
      time Joan&rsquo;s Master cf the Household, d&rsquo;Aulon, who had been with her at
      Orleans, was wounded in the heel by an arrow, and he could not walk
      without crutches. He saw that while the rest of the French had retired out
      of shot from the breach, Joan was there almost alone, with a very small
      company. D&rsquo;Aulon therefore got a horse, and rode to her to ask her to come
      out of danger. &ldquo;What are you doing here alone?&rdquo; he asked her. She took off
      her helmet and said, &ldquo;I am not alone; here I have with me fifty thousand
      of my own&rdquo; (by which she seems to have meant an invisible army of Angels);
      &ldquo;and will not leave this place till I take the town.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Aulon told her
      that she had but four or five men with her, to which she only answered by
      bidding him make her army bring faggots of wood to fill up the ditch with,
      that they might cross to the town. Then she shouted in a loud voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring up faggots, all of you!&rdquo; and they obeyed, filled up the ditch,
      attacked the breach in the wall again, rushed through, beat the English,
      and took the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was just like what Joan had done when her army was on the point cf
      retreating from the attack on Les Tourelles, at Orleans. &ldquo;One charge more&rdquo;
       was what she called for, and her men were inspired with courage, while the
      English were terrified by their refusal to be beaten. This was the last
      time that Joan led the French to such a victory. She besieged another
      town, La Charité, which was held by Burgundians, but the King did mot send
      food enough for her men, and she had to go away unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time she was troubled by a woman called Catherine of La
      Rochelle, a married woman, who declared that a lovely lady came to her at
      night, dressed all in doth of gold, and told her where treasures of money
      were hidden, which were much needed for the wars. Jean said that she must
      see this wonderful lady before she could believe in her, and she sat up
      all night with Catherine; but the lady never came. Joan told Catherine to
      go back to her husband and her children, and mind her own affairs. There
      were several people who went about saying that they had visions; but they
      were of no use, for, visions or none, they had not Joan&rsquo;s courage and
      wisdom. It is true that Catherine might have said to Joan, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see
      my golden lady, but I can&rsquo;t see your Saints, nor hear your Voices.&rdquo; The
      difference was that Joan&rsquo;s Saints and Voices had enabled her to do a great
      many wonderful things, while Catherine&rsquo;s golden lady never led to the
      finding of treasures or anything else that was of any use.

      CHAPTER XIII. HOW THE VOICES PROPHESIED EVIL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE end of the year
      of the Maid was at hand. She had often said that she would last but a
      year, or little more, counting from May 1429.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you remember that the King had made a truce with the Burgundians&mdash;an
      useless truce, for the Burgundians went on fighting, not under their own
      flag, but under the Leopards of England. The King, as usual, was loitering
      about, doing nothing. Joan heard, in spring 1430, that three or four
      hundred English were crossing the Isle of France, which is not a real
      island, but a district of that name. She was then at Lagny, on the river
      Marne, not far from Paris. So she rode out from Lagny to meet them, with a
      gentleman whom the French called &ldquo;Quenede.&rdquo; Can you guess what &ldquo;Quenede&rdquo;
       means? He was Sir Hugh Kennedy, of the great Kennedy clan in Callaway and
      Ayrshire. He had fought at the Battle of the Herrings and at Orleans, and
      he made a good deal of money in France, so that, when he went back to
      Scotland, he was called &ldquo;Hugh come wi&rsquo; the Penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Joan, with her French and Scots, came in sight of the enemy, the
      English drew themselves up on foot, along the side of a hedge, and Joan
      and the rest charged them, some on foot, some on horse, and there was hard
      fighting, for the numbers were about equal But at last all the English
      were kil&rsquo;ed or taken prisoners. There was also taken a robber knight,
      Franquet d&rsquo;Arras, who was tried for his crimes and put to death, and the
      English party among the French thought it very wicked in Jean to allow the
      rogue to be punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Easter Week Joan was at Melun one day, examining the ditch round the
      walls to see that it was in good order. Then suddenly the Voices of St.
      Catherine and St. Margaret spoke to her, and said that she should be taken
      prisoner before Midsummer day, &ldquo;and thus it needs must be,&rdquo; and that she
      was to be resigned to this, and God would help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often after this terrible day the Voices made the same prophecy, but they
      would never tell her the time and the hour. She prayed that she might die
      in that hour, for the English had often threatened her that they would
      burn her as a witch, if they caught her. Often she asked the Voices to
      warn her of the hour of her capture, for she would not have gone into
      battle on that day. But they would not tell her, and, after that, she did
      what the Captains of her party thought best, and it seems that, as to
      where or when she was to fight, she had no advice from the Voices. But she
      fought on as bravely as ever, and this was the bravest thing that ever was
      done by any one. For it was not as if the Voices had said that she should
      be killed in battle, of which she had no fear. But they said she was to be
      captured, and she knew that meant she was to be burned alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody but Joan would have gone on risking herself every day, not to
      danger of war, which is the duty of every soldier, but to the death by
      fire. If any one says that the Voices were only her fancy, and her fear
      taking a fanciful shape, we must reply that, whatever they really were,
      she believed all that they said, and thought that they were the voices of
      her sisters, the Saints. Thus the end of Joan was the most glorious thing
      in her glorious life, for many could be brave enough when the Saints
      prophesied victory, but only she could give her body to be burned for her
      country.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. HOW THE MAID WAS TAKEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E have heard how
      the town of Compiègne came over to Joan and the King, after the coronation
      at Rheims. The city had often been taken and retaken, and hold by both
      sides. But now they made up their minds that, come what might, they would
      be true to France, and now, in May, the English and Burgundians besieged
      Compiègne with a very large army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan, who was at Lagny, heard of this, and she made up her mind to help
      the good and loyal town, or perish with it. She first tried to cut the
      roads that the Duke of Burgundy used for his soldiers and supplies of
      food, but she failed to take Soissons and Pent l&rsquo;Évêque, and so shut the
      Duke off from his bridges over the rivers. So she rode into Compiègne
      under cloud of night, with her brother Pierre, and two or three hundred
      men. This was before dawn, on May 23.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town of Compiègne is on the left bank of the river Oise. Behind the
      town was a forest, through which Joan rode, and got into the town, to the
      great joy of the people. From Compiègne to the right bank of the Oise,
      where the English and Burgundians had their camps, there was a long
      bridge, fortified, that led into a great level meadow, about a mile broad.
      In wet weather the meadow was often under water from the flooded river, so
      a causeway, or raised road, was built across it, high and dry. At the end
      of the causeway, farthest from Compiègne was the village of Margny, with
      the steeple of its church, and here a part of the Burgundian army was
      encamped. Two miles and a half farther on was the village of Clairoix,
      where lay another part of the Burgundian force. About a mile and a half to
      the left of the causeway was the village of Venette, which was held by the
      English, and, about three miles off, was Coudun, where the Duke of
      Burgundy himself had his quarters. There were very large forces in front,
      and on the side, of the only road by which Joan could get at them, with
      her own men, only three hundred, probably, and any of the townspeople who
      liked to follow her on foot, with clubs and scythes, and such weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was really a very rash thing of Joan to lead so few men, by such a
      narrow road, to attack the nearest Burgundians, those at Margny, at the
      end of the causeway. The other Burgundians, farther off, and the English
      from Venette, quite near, and on Joan&rsquo;s left flank, would certainly come
      up to attack her, and help their friends at Margny. She would be
      surrounded on all sides and cut off, for the garrison of Compiègne stayed
      in the town, under their general, de Flavy, who was a great ruffian, but a
      brave man, and loyal to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why Joan, about five o&rsquo;clock in the evening of May 23. rode out with her
      little force, crossed the bridge, galloped down the causeway, and rode
      through and through the Burgundians at Margny, we do not know. Her Voices
      seem to have ceased to give her advice, only saying that she would
      certainly be captured. Perhaps she only meant to take Margny; though it is
      not easy to understand how she expected to hold it, when the whole
      Burgundian and English armies came up to recover it, as they would
      certainly do. If she aimed at more, her charge was very brave but very
      ill-judged. Joan said that her Voices did not tell her to make her
      desperate sally; it was her own idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly seventy years afterwards, two very old men said that, when they
      were young at Compiègne, they heard Joan tell a crowd of children, before
      she rode out, that &ldquo;I am betrayed, and soon will be delivered to death.
      Pray God for me, for I shall never again be able to help France and the
      King.&rdquo; One of the men was ninety-eight, so he would be quite twenty-eight
      when he heard Joan say this; if he really did hear her But, long before
      men are ninety-eight, or even eighty-six, line the other man, they are apt
      to remember things that never happened. But Joan may have told children,
      of whom she was very fond, that she knew she was soon to be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her enemies declared that she said she would take the Duke of Burgundy
      himself, but as he was several miles away, in the middle of a large army,
      while she had only three hundred of her own men, this cannot be true.
      Probably she only meant to break up the Burgundians at Margny, and show
      that she was there, to encourage the people at Compiègne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own account is that she charged the Burgundians at Margny, the nearest
      village, and drove them twice back to Clairoix, where they were reinforced
      by the great Burgundian army there, and thrust her back to the middle of
      the causeway, where she turned again, charged them, and made them retreat.
      But then the English came up from Venette, on her flank, and came between
      her and the bridge of Compiègne, and she leaped her horse off the raised
      causeway into the meadow, where she was surrounded, and pulled off her
      horse and taken, though she would not surrender. No doubt she hoped that,
      as she refused to surrender, she would be killed on the spot. When they
      cried to her to yield she said, &ldquo;I have given my faith to another than
      you, and I will keep my oath to Him,&rdquo; meaning Our Lord.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      But she was too valuable to be killed. The captors might either get a
      great ransom, a king&rsquo;s ransom, or sell her to the English to burn. The
      French would not pay the ransom, and Jean de Luxembourg, who got
      possession of her, sold her to the English. The Burgundian historian, who
      was with the Duke, and did not see the battle, says, &ldquo;the English feared
      not any captain, nor any chief in war, as they feared the Maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had done great deeds, passing the nature of woman.&rdquo; Says another
      Burgundian writer: &ldquo;She remained in the rear of her men as their captain,
      and the bravest of all, there, where fortune granted it, for the end of
      her glory, and for that last time of her bearing arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, indeed, her glory never ceased, for in her long, cruel imprisonment
      and martyrdom, she showed mere courage than any man-at-arms can display,
      where blows are given and taken.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. THE CAPTIVITY OF THE MAID
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E might suppose
      that there was not a rich man in France, or even a poor man, who would not
      have given what he could, much or little, to help to pay the ransom of the
      Maid. Jean de Luxembourg only wanted the money, and, as she was a prisoner
      of war, she might expect to be ransomed like other prisoners. It was the
      more needful to get the money and buy her freedom, as the priests of the
      University of Paris, who were on the English side, at once wrote to Jean
      de Luxembourg (July 14), and asked him to give Joan up to the Inquisition,
      to be tried by the laws of the Inquisition for the crimes of witchcraft,
      idolatry, and wrong doctrines about religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inquisitor was the head of a kind of religious Court, which tried
      people for not holding the right belief, or for witchcraft, or other
      religious offences. The rules of the Court, and the way of managing the
      trials, were what we think very unfair. But they were not more unfair than
      the methods used in Scotland after the Reformation. With us old women were
      tortured till they confessed that they were witches, and then were burned
      alive, sometimes seven or eight of them at once, for crimes which nobody
      could possibly commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      That went on in Scotland till the country was united to England, at the
      beginning of the eighteenth century, and the laws against witchcraft were
      not abolished till 1736. Many of the Presbyterian ministers, who were
      active in hunting for witches and having them put to horrid tortures, were
      very angry that the witchcraft laws were abolished. The Inquisition was
      better than the ministers and magistrates in one way: if a witch
      confessed, and promised not to do it again, she was not put to death, but
      kept in prison. In Scotland the people accused of witchcraft had not even
      this chance, which did not help Joan, as we shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is told here, to show that the French were not more stupid and
      cruel four hundred years ago, than we were in Scotland, two hundred years
      ago. But it was a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Inquisition,
      and therefore the French King and his subjects should have paid Joan&rsquo;s
      ransom at once or rescued her by force of arms. But not a coin was paid,
      and not a sword was drawn to ransom or to rescue her. The people who
      advised the King had never liked her, and now the King left her to her
      fate. She could have taken a bitter revenge on him, if she had chosen to
      tell tales; but she was loyal to the last, like Montrose to Charles II.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Joan was not a witch, and was a most religious girl, but she did
      not deny that she had talked with spirits, the spirits of the Saints; and
      her judges, who hated her, could say, and did say, that these spirits were
      devils, in disguise, and that therefore she was a witch. She always had
      known that they would do this, if they got the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean de Luxembourg did not hand Joan over to the priests at once: probably
      he was waiting to see if he could not get a better price from her French
      friends than from her English enemies. The Bishop of Beauvais was Joan&rsquo;s
      worst enemy: his odious name was Pierre Cauchon, and in July he kept
      pressing the Duke of Burgundy, then still besieging Compiègne, to make
      Jean give up the Maid. Jean kept the Maid in a castle called Beaulieu till
      August, and then sent her to another castle, Beaurevoir, near Cambrai, far
      to the north, where it would be more difficult for her friends like Dunois
      and d&rsquo;Alencon to come and rescue her by force, which we do not hear that
      they ever tried to do, though perhaps they did. The brave Xaintrailles was
      doing a thing that Joan longed for even more than for her freedom. She was
      taken in fighting to help the town of Compiègne, of which she was very
      fond, and her great grief at Beaulieu and Beaurevoir was that Compiègne
      was likely to be taken by the Burgundians and English, who threatened to
      put the people to death. All this while Xaintrailles was preparing a small
      army to deliver Compiègne.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Beaurevoir the ladies of the castle were kinsfolk of Jean de
      Luxembourg. They were good women, and very kind to Joan, and they knelt to
      Jean, weeping, and asking him to give her back to her friends. But he
      wanted his money, like the men who sold Sir William Wallace to the
      English, and the great Montrose to the preachers and Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Jean sold the Maid to the English. Joan knew this, and knew what she
      had to expect. She was allowed to take the air on the flat roof of the
      great tower at Leaurevoir, which was 60 feet high. She was not thinking so
      much of herself as of Compiègne. If she could escape she would try to make
      her way to Compiègne, and help the people to fight for their liberty and
      their lives. But how could she escape? She hoped that, if she leaped from
      the top of the tower, her Saints would bear her up in their arms, and not
      let her be hurt by the fall. So she asked them if she might leap down, but
      St. Catherine said, No; she must not leap. God would help her and the
      people of Compiègne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jean would not listen, this time, to the Voice. She said that, if the
      leap was wrong, she would rather trust her soul to the mercy of God, than
      her body to the English. And she <i>must</i> go to Compiègne, for she
      heard that, when the town was taken, all the people, old and young, were
      to be put to the sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0119.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then she leaped, and there she lay. She was not hurt, not a bone of her
      was broken, which is an extraordinary thing, but she could not move a
      limb. The people of the castle came and took her back to her prison room.
      She did not know what had happened, and for three days she ate nothing.
      Then her memory came back to her and to her sorrows. Why was she not
      allowed to die! St. Catherine told her that she had sinned, and must
      confess, and ask the Divine mercy. But she was to go through with her
      appointed task. &ldquo;Take no care for thy torment,&rdquo; said the Voice; &ldquo;thence
      shalt thou come into Paradise.&rdquo; Moreover, St. Catherine promised that
      Compiègne should be rescued before Martinmas. That was the last good news,
      and the last happy thing that came to Joan in the days of her life; for,
      just before Martinmas, her friend, Pothon de Xaintrailles, rode with his
      men-at-arms through the forest of Compiègne, whilst others of the French
      attacked the English and Burgundians on the farther side of the Oise, and
      so the Saint kept her promise, and Compiègne was saved.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. THE TRIAL OF THE MAID
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S Joan was a
      woman, and a prisoner of the Church, when the English had handed her over
      to the priests, she ought to have been kept in gentle prison, and with
      only women about her. But the English were very cruel. They had a kind of
      cage made, called a <i>huche</i>, and put in a strong room in the Castle
      of Rouen. In this cage they kept Joan, with chains on. her legs, which
      were fastened to a strong post or beam of the bed. Five common soldiers
      kept watch in the room, day and night; the eyes of men were always on the
      most modest of girls. We see how much they feared her. They wished to have
      her proved a witch, and one who dealt with devils, to take away the shame
      of having been defeated by a girl, and also to disgrace the French King by
      making the world believe that he had been helped by a sorceress and her
      evil spirits. In truth, if you read <i>Henry VI</i>., Part L, by
      Shakespeare, you will see just what the English thought about the Maid.
      Shakespeare, of course, did not know the true story of Joan, and he makes
      her say abominable things, which not even her enemies brought up against
      her at her Trial. If Shakespeare wrote the play, he did not care a penny
      for the truth of the story. He sends Joan to Bordeaux, where she never was
      in her life, and makes &ldquo;Fiends&rdquo; (that is, her Saints) appear to her, and
      show that they will help her no longer. So she offers her very soul as a
      sacrifice for the sake of France:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Before that England give the French the foil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Later she turns on the English, and says what she might have said with
      truth:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I never had to do with wicked spirits:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Stained with the guiltless blood of innocents,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Because you want the grace that others have,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      You judge it straight a thing impossible
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To compass wonders but by help of devils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The English had devils on their own side, the cruel priests and Bishop
      Cauchon, whom they had promised to make Archbishop of Rouen. But he never
      got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three months these people examined Joan every day, sometimes all
      shouting at her at once, so that she said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, if you please, one
      at a time.&rdquo; She had no advocate, who knew the law, to help her to defend
      herself. But once, when she appealed to the Council of Basle, a Council cf
      the Church which was then sitting, they bade her be silent, and told the
      clerk who took down everything in writing, in French, not to write down
      her appeal. There is nothing about this in the Latin book of the Trial,
      translated from the French, but in the French copy, mode in court, you see
      the place where the clerk&rsquo;s pen has stepped at the words, &ldquo;and she
      appeals&rdquo; (<i>Et requiert</i>, in French). He was going to write the rest.
      Now she had a right to appeal, and as the clergy at the Council of Basle
      were of many countries, they would not have taken the English side, but
      pronounced Joan innocent. The Bishops and clergy of the loyal French party
      at Poitiers, before she went to the war, had declared her innocent and a
      thing of God, after a long examination of her life up till April 1429.
      Joan often asked her judges to send for &ldquo;the Poitiers book,&rdquo; where they
      would find answers to their questions about her early days; but they vexed
      her about everything, even about the fairy tree, on which the children
      used to hang their garlands. Their notion seems to have been that the
      fairies were her helpers, not the Saints, and that the fairies were evil
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan had shown that, in war and politics, she was wiser than the soldiers
      and statesmen. She went straight at the work to be done&mdash;to beat the
      English, and to keep attacking them before they got back their confidence.
      At her Trial she showed that she was far wiser than the learned priests.
      They tried to prove that she was helped by fairies. She said that she did
      not believe there were any fairies: and though I would not say that there
      are <i>none</i>, there certainly are not so many, or so busy and powerful,
      as the priests supposed. They kept asking her about the prophecies of
      Merlin the Wizard: she thought nothing of Merlin the Wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She vowed to speak truth in answer to questions, but she would not answer
      questions about her Saints and Voices, except when they gave her
      permission. The judges troubled her most about the secret of the King, and
      what she told him about that, before she went to the wars. You remember
      that the King had secretly prayed to know whether he really was the son of
      the late King or not, and that Joan told him of his prayer, and told him
      that he was the son of the late King, and had the right to be King
      himself. But she would tell the Judges nothing about all this matter. If
      she had, the English would have cried everywhere, &ldquo;You see he is not
      certain himself that he is what he pretends to be. <i>Our</i> King of
      England is the only King of France.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0127.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Joan would not betray her King&rsquo;s doubts. She never would tell what
      happened. At last she cold a simple parable: an Angel came with a rich
      crown for the King. But, later, she explained that by the Angel she meant
      herself, and that by the Crown, she meant her having him crowned at
      Rheims. They never could get the King&rsquo;s secret out of her. At last they
      said they would put her to the torture. They took her to a horrible vault,
      full of abominable instruments for pinching, and tearing, and roasting,
      and screwing the bodies of men. There stood the executioner, with his arms
      bare, and his fire lit, and all his pincers, and ropes, and pulleys ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now will you tell us?&rdquo; they said. Brave men had turned faint with terror
      in that vault, and had said anything that they were asked to say, rather
      than face the pain. There was a Marshal of France, Gilles de Rais, a
      nobleman who fought beside Joan at Orleans, at Les Tourelles, at Jargeau,
      at Pathay, and at Paris, and who carried the sacred vessel which the Angel
      brought, long ago, with holy oil, at the King&rsquo;s coronation. Later this man
      was accused by the Inquisition of the most horrible crimes. Among other
      things, he was said to have sacrificed children to the devil, and to have
      killed hundreds of little boys for his own amusement. But hundreds of
      little boys were not proved to be missing, and none of their remains were
      ever found. Gilles de Rais denied these horrible charges; he said he was
      innocent, and, for all that we know, he was. But they took him to the
      torture vault, and showed him the engines of torment, and he confessed
      everything, so that he might be put to death without torture, which was
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan did not fear and turn faint. She said, &ldquo;Torture me if you please.
      Tear my body to pieces. Whatever I say in my pains will not be true, and
      as soon as I am released I will deny that it was true. Now, go on!&rdquo; Many
      priests wished to go on, but more, even of these cruel enemies, said,
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; they would not torture the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brave lass. Pity she is not English!&rdquo; one of the English lords
      said, when he saw Joan standing up against the crowd of priests and
      lawyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that, for six weeks, during Lent, Joan took no food all day.
      There she stood, starving, and answering everybody, always bravely, always
      courteously, always wisely, and sometimes even merrily. They kept asking
      her the same questions on different days, to try to make her vary in her
      answers. All the answers were written down. Once they said she had
      answered differently before, and, when the book was examined, it proved
      that there was some mistake in the thing, and that Jean was in the right.
      She was much pleased, and said to the clerk, &ldquo;If you make mistakes again,
      I will pull your ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They troubled her very much about wearing boy&rsquo;s dress. She said that, when
      among men in war, it was better and more proper. She was still among men,
      with soldiers in her room, day and night, which was quite unlawful; she
      should have had only women about her. She would not put on women&rsquo;s dress
      while she was among men, and was quite in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hear her Voices in Court, but not clearly on account of the
      noise. Once, I suppose, she heard them, for she suddenly said, in the
      middle of an answer to a question about the letters which were written for
      her when she was in the wars:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before seven years are passed the English will lose a greater stake than
      they have lost at Orleans; they will lose everything in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the seven years were out they lost Paris, a much greater stake than
      Orleans, as Paris was the chief town and the largest They went on losing
      till they lost everything in France, even all that they had held for
      hundreds of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judges insisted that she should submit to the Church. Joan asked
      nothing better. &ldquo;Take me to the Pope, and I will answer him, for I know
      and believe that we should obey our Holy Father, the Pope, who is in
      Rome.&rdquo; Or she would answer the Council of the whole Church at Basle, but,
      as I said, the Bishop Cauchon stopped the clerk when he was writing down
      the words. The Judges said &ldquo;<i>We</i> are the Church; answer us and obey
      us.&rdquo; But, of course, they were not the Church; they were only a set of
      disloyal French priests who sided against their own country, and helped
      the English.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. HOW THE PRIESTS BETRAYED THE MAID
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T last, on May 24,
      1431, they determined to force her to acknowledge herself in the wrong,
      and to deny her Saints. On that day they took her to the graveyard of the
      Church of St. Ouen. Two platforms had been built; on one stood the
      wretched Cauchon with his gang; Joan was placed on the other. There was
      also a stake with faggots, for burning Joan. They had ready two written
      papers: on one it was written that Joan would submit to them, and wear
      woman&rsquo;s dress. On the other was a long statement that her Saints were evil
      spirits, and that she had done all sorts of wrong things. She was told
      that if she would sign the short paper, and wear womans dress, she would
      be put in gentle prison, with women about her instead of English soldiers.
      Seeing the fire ready, Jean repeated the <i>short</i> form of words, and
      made her mark, smiling, on the piece of paper that they gave her, but it
      was the paper with the long speech, accusing herself of crimes and denying
      her Saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what we are told, but, later, she showed that she thought she had
      denied her Saints, so it is not easy to be quite sure of what happened. It
      is certain that Cauchon broke his word. She was not taken away from her
      cruel prison and the English soldiers, as was promised. She was given
      woman&rsquo;s dress; but, as they were determined to make her &ldquo;relapse,&rdquo; that
      is, return to the sin of wearing man&rsquo;s dress, for then they could burn
      her, they put her boy&rsquo;s dress in her room, and so acted that she was
      obliged to put it on. It is a horrid story, not fit to be told, of cruelty
      and falseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we have her!&rdquo; said Cauchon to an Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to her, and asked her if the Voices had come to her again?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Catherine and St. Margaret told me that I had done very wrong, when I
      said what I did to save my life, and that I was damning myself to save my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you believe that the Voices were the voices of the Saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe that, and that the Voices come from God;&rdquo; and she said
      that she did not mean ever to have denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of her burning, the Bishop and the rest went to Joan again, and
      wrote out a statement that she left it to the Church to say whether her
      Voices were good or bad. The Church has decided that they were good, and
      has given Joan the title of &ldquo;Venerable,&rdquo; which is the first step toward
      proclaiming her to be one of the Saints. Whatever the Voices were, she
      said they were <i>real</i>, not fancied things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this paper does not count, for the clerk who took all the notes
      refused to go with the Bishop to see Joan, that time, saying that it was
      no part of the law, and that they went as private men, not as Judges, and
      he had the courage not to sign the paper. He was an honest man, and
      thought Joan a good girl, unlawfully treated, and was very sorry for her.
      &ldquo;He never wept so much for any sorrow in all his life, and for a month he
      could not be quiet for sorrow: and he bought a book of prayers and prayed
      for the soul of the Maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This honest man&rsquo;s name was Gilbert Manchon.

      CHAPTER XVIII. THE END OF THE MAID
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY burned her
      cruelly to death in the market-place of Rouen, with eight hundred soldiers
      round the stake, lest any should attempt to save her. They had put a false
      accusation on a paper cap, and set it on her head: it was written that she
      was &ldquo;Heretic, Relapsed, Apostate, Idolatress.&rdquo; This was her reward for the
      bravest and best life that was ever lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>She came to her own and her own received her not</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was with her a priest who pitied her, not one of her Judges&mdash;Brother
      Isambert de la Pierre, of the order of St. Augustine. Joan asked him to
      bring her a cross, and to hold it up before her eyes while she was
      burning. &ldquo;Saith moreover that while she was in the fire she ceased never
      to call loudly on the Holy Name of Jesus; always, too, imploring:
      ceaselessly the help of the Saints in Paradise; and more, when the end was
      now come, she bowed her head, and gave up her spirit, calling on the name
      of Jesus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Saints had said to her, long before: &ldquo;Bear your torment lightly:
      thence shall you come into the kingdom of Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So died Joan the Maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said by some who were present, that even the English Cardinal,
      Beaufort, wept when he saw the Maid die: &ldquo;crocodiles&rsquo; tears!&rdquo; One of the
      secretaries of Henry VI. (who himself was only a little boy) said, &ldquo;We are
      all lost. We have burned a Saint!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all lost. The curse of their cruelty did not depart from them.
      Driven by the French and Scots from province to province, and from town to
      town, the English returned home, tore and rent each other; murdering their
      princes and nobles on the scaffold, and slaying them as prisoners of war
      on the field; and stabbing and smothering them in chambers of the Tower;
      York and Lancaster devouring each other; the man Henry VI. was driven from
      home to wander by the waves at St. Andrews, before he wandered back to
      England and the dagger stroke-these things were the reward the English
      won, after they had burned a Saint, they ate the bread and drank the cup
      of their own greed and cruelty all through the Wars of the Roses. They
      brought shame upon their name which Time can never wash away; they did the
      Devil&rsquo;s work, and took the Devil&rsquo;s wages. Soon Henry VIII. was butchering
      his wives and burning Catholics and Protestants, now one, now the other,
      as the humour seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan had said to the Archbishop, at Rheims, that she knew not where she
      would die, or where she would be buried. Her ashes were never laid in the
      earth; she had no grave. The English, that men might forget her, threw her
      ashes into the sea. There remains no relic of Joan of Arc; no portrait,
      nothing she ever wore, no cup or sword or jewel that she ever touched. But
      she is not forgotten; she never will be forgotten. On every Eighth of May,
      the day when she turned the tide of English conquest, a procession in her
      honour goes through the streets of Orleans, the city that she saved; and
      though the Protestants, at the Reformation, destroyed her statue that
      knelt before the Fair Cross on the bridge, she has statues in many of the
      towns in France. She was driven from the gate of Paris, but near the place
      where she lay wounded in the ditch, is her statue, showing her on
      horseback, in armour.

      CHAPTER XIX. THE SECOND TRIAL OF THE MAID
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE rich and the
      strong had not paid a franc, or drawn a sword to ransom or to rescue Joan.
      The poor had prayed for her, and the written prayers which they used may
      still be seen. Probably the others would have been glad to let Joan&rsquo;s
      memory perish, but to do this was not convenient. If Joan had been a
      witch, a heretic, an impostor, an apostate, as was declared in her
      condemnation, then the King had won his battles by the help of a heretic
      and a witch. Twenty years after Joan&rsquo;s martyrdom, when the King had
      recovered Normandy and Rouen, he thought it time to take care of his own
      character, and to inquire into the charges on which she was found guilty.
      It is fair to say that he could not do this properly till he was master of
      Rouen, the place at which she was tried. Some of the people concerned were
      asked questions, such as the good clerk, Manchon, and Deaupèrc, one of the
      Judges. He was a man of some sense: he did not think that Joan was a
      witch, but that she was a fanciful girl, who thought that she saw Saints
      and heard Voices, when she neither saw nor heard anything. Many mad people
      hear Voices which are also mad; Joan&rsquo;s Voices were perfectly sane and
      wise, and told her things that she could not have known of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not much came of this examination, but, two years later, Joan&rsquo;s mother and
      brothers prayed for a new trial to clear the character of the family. It
      is the most extraordinary thing that, up to this year, 1452, Joan&rsquo;s
      brothers and cousins seem to have been living, on the best terms, with the
      woman who pretended to be Joan, and said that she had not been burned, but
      had escaped. This was a jolly kind of woman, fond of eating and drinking
      and playing tennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why Joan&rsquo;s brothers and cousins continued to be friendly with her after
      the King found her out, because she did not know his secret, is the
      greatest of puzzles, for she was a detected impostor, and no money could
      be got from the connection with her. Another very amazing thing is that,
      in 1436, an aunt of the Duke of Burgundy, Madame de Luxembourg,
      entertained the impostor, while the whole town of Orleans welcomed her,
      and made her presents, and ceased holding a religious service on the day
      of Joan&rsquo;s death, for here, they said, she was, quite well and merry!
      Moreover the town&rsquo;s books of accounts, at Orleans, show that they paid a
      pension to Joan&rsquo;s mother as &ldquo;Mother of the Maid,&rdquo; till 1452, when they say
      &ldquo;Mother of the <i>late</i> Maid.&rdquo; For now, as Joan&rsquo;s family were trying to
      have her character cleared, they admitted that she was dead, burned to
      death in 1431, as, of course, she really was. There are not many things
      more curious than this story of the False Maid.

      However, at last Joan&rsquo;s family gave up the impostor, and, five years
      later, she was imprisoned, and let out again, and that is the last we hear
      of her. The new Trial lingered on, was begun, and put off, and begun again
      in 1455. Cauchon was dead by this time; nothing could be done to him.
      Scores of witnesses came and told the stories given at the beginning of
      this book, showing how Joan was the best and most religious of girls, and
      very kind to people even more poor than herself, and very industrious in
      knitting and sewing and helping her mother. Every one who was still alive,
      that had known her in the wars, came, like d&rsquo;Alençon, and Dunois, and
      d&rsquo;Aulon, and her confessor: and many others came, and told about Joan in
      the wars, how brave she was and modest, and the stories of what she had
      suffered in prison, and about the unfairness of her trial, were repeated.

    <p>
      The end was that the Court of Inquiry-declared her trial to have been full
      of unlawfulness and cruelty, and they abolished the sentence against her
      and took off all the shameful reproaches, and ordered a beautiful cross to
      be erected to her memory in the place where she was burned to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here ends the story of the Life and Death of Joan the Maid.
